  <h2>In a nutshell...</h2>
  <p>
    A proud son of NorCal transplanted to the South, I had my B.A. in Literatures from <a href="http://ucsd.edu">UC San Diego</a> and decided to stick around (pick a reason).  Lit hasn't been the growth industry they told me it would be, so I've put my self to work in Human Resources and Finance, which have occupied my time equally over the past 6 years.

  <p>In the spare time there is always soccer, scuba, brewing and the books on my shelf, so if the <a href="http://xolos.com.mx">Xolos</a> aren't winning and <a href="http://divebums.com/dive-sites/La-Jolla-Cove.html">La Jolla's</a> viz is bad, I've still got homebrew and <a href="http://marktwainproject.org/xtf/view?docId=works/MTDP10362.xml;chunk.id=fr0001;toc.depth=1;toc.id=fr0001;citations=;style=work;brand=mtp#X">that one I've been meaning to read</a>.

  <p>When the <a href="http://goldenstateofmind.com">Dubs</a> aren't raining threes, that is.
